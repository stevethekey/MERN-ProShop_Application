# MERN-ProShop_Application
Learning MERN stack by creating a shopping application named "ProShop". 

This is a simulation of a full stack website. The website itself is a basic shopping website named ProShop. The products featured are stuff like IPhone, PS4, a camera, 
and AirPods. Keep in mind I do not own these products nor is this an actual website meant to sell!

The point of this repository is to follow along the Umedy walkthrough and learn MERN by creating a pratical applicaiton, in which skills learned here can be carried 
over to the industry.
